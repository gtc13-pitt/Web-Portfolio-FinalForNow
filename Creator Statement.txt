Rhetorically, I would see users finding this site through a QR code, or maybe already presented to them at a kiosk during a tableing event. There is some work left to be done, but as of now, the skeleton and most design cues are there to stay. I like how it looks aesthetically, especially with the modern color scheme and easy to read text. I still have a few bugs to work out, mainly my <div> columns, especially regarding the flip button. I can't figure out why it will not adjust according to the box. Before the final revision is due, I will work towards fixing up, and adding more links at the bottom of the page, along with more information about the greater foundation and potentially a video that will be able to be played through the browser, though I'm not sure that GitHub will allow that large of a file format.
